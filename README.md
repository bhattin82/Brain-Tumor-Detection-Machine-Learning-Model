# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Machine-Learning-Model

In this project, I have created a **machine learning model using TensorFlow** that predicts if an individual has a brain tumor or not.  This model can effectively predict the following types of tumors with a **91** percent accuracy: **Meningioma**, **Glioma** and **Pituitary**. If a tumor is present, it prints in **red**; however, if a tumor is not present, it prints in **green**. I have also given explanations for each section of code so that it is easy to follow. 

Meningioma Tumor:

For this project, I worked on the **Google Collaboratory Notebook**. The dataset was obtained from **Kaggle**.
